# clean-architecture
This project features my thoughts around clean architecture from uncle bob. Though I did not follow clean architecture 100% but many of ideas of clean architecture like dependency inversion principle are involved. I've also followed KISS and allowed a bit of technical debt in core package. I followed Domain Driven Design while working with core package. Patterns like repository, specification, entity and service are straight from DDD. While creating DDD domain classes I avoided anamic model anti pattern as Martin Fowler suggested. The project is created using spring boot and spring rest is used as well. It is a running project.
